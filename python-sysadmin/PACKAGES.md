# Working with python packages

### Pip

- pip is used to manage third-party packages in the system
- It will look through the PyPI to look for packages that you need
- You can search for available packages/module that other people have made and use them!!

PyPI : <https://pypi.org/>

### Python Virtual Environment

Pip can set up a virtual environment for your project, which by default, will do a few things that will make your life so much easier. You are advised to separate each project in an environment that is separated from your system so you don't end up in a dependency hell later on.

    - Set up a different python path (binaries, libraries, etc) with symlink
    - Set up a different prompt for your shell
    - Sandbox your entire python environment
